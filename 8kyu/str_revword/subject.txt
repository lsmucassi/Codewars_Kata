Reversing Words in a String

Caution: This kata does not currently have any known supported versions for Python. It may not be completable due to dependencies on out-dated libraries/language versions.
You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

reverse('Hello World') == 'World Hello'
reverse('Hi There.') == 'There. Hi'
Happy coding!
