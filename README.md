# Codewars_Kata

## About Codewars
Codewars is a community of developers, which are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills.
Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.

## Why Codewars?
Learning from Others
Every time you complete a challenge (which we call "kata") you will be shown the solutions that others came up with.
Until you try it yourself,
you really won't know how great of a feeling it is to complete a kata thinking you nailed it and then see how others did it,
or how many different types of approaches are possible. It is an amazing way to learn and adapt new techniques.
